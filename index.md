[Messaging Layer Security (MLS)](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/) is an
[IETF standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9420/) for end-to-end encryption in messaging systems.  We are
investigating bringing MLS to Matrix.  So far we have basic encryption and
decryption working and can handle membership changes.

## Why MLS?

In most cases, MLS has better performance in large groups than Olm/Megolm.  The
graph below shows a comparison[¬π](#fn1) between some MLS and Olm/Megolm operations.

![Comparison graph](comparison.png)

The graph gives a simplified comparison, but gives an idea of their relative
performance.  In most cases, MLS is faster than Olm/Megolm.  But one case in
which MLS can be much slower when adding a large number of users to a group at
a time.  It is expected that this would not be a common occurrence.

However, integrating MLS into Matrix is not a simple task.  One of the biggest
hurdles is that MLS assumes that epochs (essentially, the state of an MLS tree
in between updates to the tree) have a linear ordering.  However, Matrix being
a decentralised system with no central authority, it is difficult to enforce a
linear ordering.  Thus we must either determine a way to do so, or work around
this limitation.

In addition, we need to investigate how other Matrix features, such as key
backups, interact with MLS.

# Tasks

(tasks are not necessarily in order)

## Initial investigation
- ‚úÖ create trial implementation of MLS
  - [source code](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/mls-ts/)
- ‚úÖ investigate non-decentralised MLS on Matrix
- ‚úÖ investigate and test strategies for decentralised MLS
  - [ideas](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/mls-ts/-/blob/decentralised2/decentralised.org)
  - [source
    code](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/mls-ts/-/tree/decentralised2)
- ‚úÖ investigate backfilling commit messages
- ‚úÖ performance comparison between (non-decentralised) MLS and Olm/Megolm
  - [source code](https://gitlab.matrix.org/uhoreg/mls-comparison)
  - [initial comparison](https://gitlab.matrix.org/uhoreg/mls-comparison/-/wikis/home)

## Implementation
- ‚úÖ investigate suitability of [OpenMLS](https://github.com/openmls/openmls)
  (Rust implementation of MLS) as a base for decentralised MLS
- ‚úÖ create a library for decentralised MLS: [matrix-dmls](https://gitlab.matrix.org/uhoreg/matrix-dmls)
- ‚è≥ proof of concept implementation in a client (Element Web) ‚ö†Ô∏è This
  implementation does not persist state, so if you reload the page, you will
  lose data.  Only use with test accounts.
